write a python program which can read json file with utf-8 encoding

create a for loop which has a range of len(log>entries) and

try to find all the keys inside log>entries>range value>response>content>text who has "users" in its value and append its index number into a list otherwise skip

Now loop through all index number which was appended go to log>entries> index number>response>content>text and load it as json

Now create a loop through key named as users and append all key values named as username, full_name, is_private, is verified and profile_pic_url in different lists then convert them into data frame


CODE : 

import json
import pandas as pd

# Read JSON file with UTF-8 encoding
with open('data.json', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
    data = json.load(file)

# Initialize lists to store extracted data
usernames = []
full_names = []
is_private_list = []
is_verified_list = []
profile_pic_urls = []

# Iterate over log entries
for i in range(len(data['log']['entries'])):
    entry = data['log']['entries'][i]

    # Check if 'users' is in the value of 'text' key
    if 'users' in entry['response']['content']['text']:
        # Append the index number to the list
        index = i

        # Load the 'text' value as JSON
        json_data = json.loads(entry['response']['content']['text'])

        # Iterate over 'users' keys
        for user in json_data['users']:
            usernames.append(user['username'])
            full_names.append(user['full_name'])
            is_private_list.append(user['is_private'])
            is_verified_list.append(user['is_verified'])
            profile_pic_urls.append(user['profile_pic_url'])

# Create a DataFrame from the extracted data
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Username': usernames,
    'Full Name': full_names,
    'Is Private': is_private_list,
    'Is Verified': is_verified_list,
    'Profile Pic URL': profile_pic_urls
})

# Print the DataFrame
print(df)
